## MineThatData Challenge: E-Mail Analytics And Data Mining Challenge 

Data set described and uploaded by Kevin Hillstrom in this [post](https://blog.minethatdata.com/2008/03/minethatdata-e-mail-analytics-and-data.html).

The data set has two groups of information: the historical customer attributes, and the marketing campaign information. Here is the summary about the data set:

64000 customers are divided into two groups: two-third of them (variant B) recieve a marketing email and the rest recieve no email (variant A). During the next two weeks after sending the email, a fraction of customers from both variants (convert and) visit a target website and may make a purchase. The purchase amount is recorded in dollar value.

The information about the marketing campaign can help us to build A/B testing framework and study the conversion rates and revenue. The historical data about customers can also help us to study the customer behavior.

## Mobile Games A/B Testing

The second data set comes from a mobile puzzle game, is aimed for A/B testing, and is real data. It is best described in this [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yufengsui/datacamp-project-mobile-games-a-b-testing/notebook), but here is the summary:

The data shows informatioin about 90,000 users who installed the game and played it for a while. In the original version of the game (variant A), a gate is placed at level 30, whereas for variant B the gate is moved to level 40. The gate simply stops the player for a short while and the let them continue the game.
The data shows that in either of the versions, only a fraction of players come back and play one day after installing the game. The A/B test can be conducted by comparing the conversion rates of the two variants. To study the revenue, we can add fictious dollar values representing in-app purchases to the data set.
