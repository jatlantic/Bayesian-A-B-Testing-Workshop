    "The data is collected in a company that provides an online service. The company wants to increase the number of users that sign up for the service. To achieve this goal, the company wants to test a new version of the website. They randomly assign users into two groups: the control group `A` and the treatment group `B`. The users in the control group were shown the old version of the website, while the users in the treatment group were shown the new version of the website. The company then tracked whether the users signed up for the service or not. They also tracked how much money the users spent after signing up for the service. \n",
