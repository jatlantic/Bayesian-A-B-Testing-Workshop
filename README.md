# Bayesian-A-B-Testing-Workshop

This repository contains the publicly available material for the Bayesian A/B testing workshop between WEF and EPFL.

# Dates

28.09.2023 and 29.09.2023, Geneva.

# Getting Started

Make sure you have the packages installed that are listed in the **00_env_setup** folder. Assuming you have conda or anaconda, this can be done by running `conda env create -n workshop --file workshop.yml` from the terminal in the **00_env_setup** folder.
Then run workshop.ipynb which is in the same folder to make sure everything works.

Now you can go through the exercises in the folder `02_notebooks`.
